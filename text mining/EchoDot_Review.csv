Fantastic Addition to My Home - Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen Review",5.0,"I recently purchased the Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen smart speaker from Amazon, and I must say it has quickly become an essential part of my daily routine. This device is simply outstanding, and I can't imagine my life without it now.First and foremost, the audio quality is impressive. The speaker produces rich, clear sound that fills the room with music. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlists or asking Alexa to play the news or podcasts, the audio experience is always top-notch. The bass is deep, and the trebles are crisp, resulting in a well-balanced sound profile.The voice recognition capabilities of Alexa are exceptional. She accurately picks up my voice commands even when I'm across the room or playing music at higher volumes. It's a joy to interact with Alexa, who responds promptly and provides useful information or performs tasks effortlessly. From setting reminders and alarms to checking the weather or controlling my smart home devices, Alexa is like a personal assistant always at my beck and call.I also appreciate the sleek and modern design of the Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen. Its compact size allows it to fit seamlessly into any room without taking up too much space. The fabric finish adds a touch of elegance, making it aesthetically pleasing and blending well with my home decor.The setup process was a breeze. It took me just a few minutes to connect the speaker to my Wi-Fi network and link it to my Amazon account. The intuitive Alexa app guided me through the process step by step, ensuring a seamless setup experience.One feature I particularly enjoy is the integration with other smart devices. I can effortlessly control my compatible lights, thermostats, and even my TV using voice commands through Alexa. It has truly made my home smarter and more convenient.In terms of privacy, Amazon has made great strides in addressing concerns. The ability to mute the microphone easily provides peace of mind when I don't want Alexa listening in. I appreciate the transparency and control Amazon offers in this regard.Overall, the Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen smart speaker is a phenomenal addition to any home. Its exceptional audio quality, impressive voice recognition, seamless setup process, and integration with smart devices make it a must-have device. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their daily routines and enjoy the benefits of a truly smart home assistant.", 18 May 2023

Exceptional for price range !!! Short conclusion in advance just buy it if you want !!!!!!!!",5.0,Pros :1. Voice recognition: REALLY really good!!!!!( sorry for overacting but trust me it‚Äôs really good )2. Build quality. ( really durable and good!!!)3. Loudness : For this compact size and my requirements it more than enough .4. Sound quality : The audio is really amazing the vocals are crisp and clear .  The bass is really sufficient but not very much (like heavy bass) but it‚Äôs good and really good .Cons :1. Biggest con is it always has to be connected for functioning and here in India electricity cuts quite often which is really disturbing but whenever there is electricity it works so smoothly .So the conclusion is if you want speaker under 3000 with good sound quality you can go with this one .It Beates every other speaker in this price range for vocals and sound clarity EASILY!!!. But if you love bass and want a smart speaker that too  you can go with it‚Äôs upper model which has heavy bass as well and it‚Äôs around 3000-3200 it‚Äôs price differs but not more than 3200 . With offer you will get a smart bulb of 600-700 of only 100 which is also really good.( I missed that offer with my Alexa üò≠üò≠ü•≤ so don‚Äôt miss it .), 28 June 2022

Simply amazing",5.0,"I don't know why you guys keep on creating new generation. This is 3rd generation but really awesome, good loud sound, Alexa assistant is better in a way it works in phone app. Home automation is really awesome if device supports supports Alexa device. Even its possible to connect laptops audio to Alexa using bluetooth.One sidenote, use bracket to mount Alexa on wall mount using charger socket.

Product is good, but needs improvements.",3.0,"I have been use this alexa Echo dot 3 for more than 10 months. So, here I'm sharing some points of my experience.1. Responsive : The response of the device is good, it understand the job. But, after a while the response time, understanding of commands not good. You can understand, like I have to claim replacement twice in 10 months.2. Great Entertainment : No doubt it is a great option for Entertainment. The sound is great and loud. Sometimes you can just talk to her can ask for jokes, intresting facts, some GK or history question. It can be a great partner of children's in study but with some limitations.3. Feel Like Family : Yes, you read it correct. It can be a part of your family. Like when your away from home, and no one's there to talk with the person alone at home if any. He/She can vibe with alexa and enjoy the moment. Till someone back home.Note : These are my personal experience, make sure that your requirement does need this or not before you buy.", 21 August 2023

Decent product, but has many software bugs... Hope they are fixed in the future.",4.0,"Hello,I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference.", 28 April 2021
